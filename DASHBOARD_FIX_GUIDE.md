# Dashboard Performance Optimization Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Continuous Auto-Refresh (Rate Limiting Problem)
**Problem**: Multiple dashboard components were refreshing every 30 seconds, causing rate limit exceeded errors.

**Solutions Applied**:
- **useDashboardData hook**: Increased refresh interval from 30s to 60s with exponential backoff on errors
- **SystemStatus component**: Increased refresh from 30s to 2 minutes
- **AdminControlPanel**: Increased refresh from 30s to 5 minutes  
- **Header notifications**: Increased refresh from 1 minute to 5 minutes
- **Rate limit**: Increased from 100 to 300 requests per 15-minute window

### 2. Failed Request Retry Loops
**Problem**: Failed API requests were causing infinite retry loops.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Added retry count limit (max 5 retries)
- Implemented exponential backoff (1min → 2min → 4min → max 5min)
- Stop auto-refresh on rate limit or auth errors
- Prevent concurrent requests in notification loading

### 3. Settings Panel Redundant Loading
**Problem**: Settings panel was reloading data every time tabs switched.

**Solutions Applied**:
- Cache loaded data to prevent unnecessary requests
- Only load data when not already present
- Added proper error handling with user feedback

## Configuration Changes

### Backend (.env)
```
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=300  # Increased from 100
```

### Frontend Intervals
- Dashboard data: 60s (was 30s)
- System status: 120s (was 30s) 
- Admin panel: 300s (was 30s)
- Notifications: 300s (was 60s)

## Testing the Fix

1. **Run the test script**:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/MamaCare
   node test-dashboard-load.js
   ```

2. **Monitor for improvements**:
   - No more continuous loading spinners
   - No rate limit errors in browser console
   - Reduced network requests in browser DevTools
   - Stable dashboard performance

## Monitoring Commands

### Check backend logs for rate limiting:
```bash
# In backend directory
tail -f logs/production.log | grep "rate limit"
```

### Check browser console for errors:
```javascript
// In browser console
console.clear();
// Wait 2 minutes and check for errors
```

## Additional Recommendations

1. **Implement request caching** with short TTL for frequently accessed data
2. **Add request deduplication** to prevent duplicate concurrent requests
3. **Use websockets** for real-time updates instead of polling
4. **Implement proper loading states** with skeleton screens
5. **Add request queue** to handle failed requests gracefully

## Emergency Reset

If issues persist:

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage**
2. **Restart backend server** to reset rate limits
3. **Check network connectivity** between frontend and backend
4. **Verify CORS configuration** matches deployed URLs
