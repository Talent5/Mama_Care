# MamaCare Authentication and Profile Display Fixes

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. Over-aggressive Authentication Checks
**Problem**: The `AuthGuard` component was performing server-side authentication checks every 5 minutes and on every screen change, causing unnecessary re-authentication prompts.

**Fix**: 
- Simplified `AuthGuard` to only check if user has valid token and user data in memory
- Removed periodic authentication checks
- Removed server calls that could fail and trigger logouts

**Files Modified**:
- `components/AuthGuard.tsx`

### 2. Inconsistent User Data Sources
**Problem**: The app was using both `authService` and `DatabaseAuthStorage` for user data, causing inconsistencies and potential sync issues.

**Fix**:
- Created `utils/userUtils.ts` with helper functions for consistent user data access
- Modified `DashboardScreen` and `ProfileScreen` to use `authService` as primary source
- Added fallback to `DatabaseAuthStorage` only when needed

**Files Modified**:
- `screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`
- `screens/ProfileScreen.tsx`
- Created `utils/userUtils.ts`

### 3. Token Validation Issues
**Problem**: `authService.isLoggedIn()` was making server calls for token validation on every check, causing logouts when server was slow or unreachable.

**Fix**:
- Simplified `isLoggedIn()` method to only check local authentication state
- Removed automatic server-side token validation
- Server validation now only happens when explicitly needed

**Files Modified**:
- `services/authService.ts`

### 4. TypeScript Configuration Issues
**Problem**: TSConfig had formatting issues and missing skipLibCheck option causing compilation errors.

**Fix**:
- Fixed JSON formatting in `tsconfig.json`
- Added `skipLibCheck: true` to ignore external library type issues

**Files Modified**:
- `tsconfig.json`

## New Features Added:

### 1. User Utilities (`utils/userUtils.ts`)
- `getCurrentUserData()`: Get current user in consistent format
- `convertToStoredUser()`: Convert auth user to StoredUser format
- `isUserAuthenticated()`: Simple authentication check
- `getUserDisplayName()`: Get user display name

### 2. Improved User Experience
- Faster authentication checks (no unnecessary server calls)
- More reliable profile data display
- Consistent user information across screens
- Better error handling for authentication failures

## Key Benefits:

1. **Faster App Performance**: Eliminated unnecessary server calls on every screen change
2. **More Reliable Authentication**: Simplified authentication checks reduce false logouts
3. **Consistent User Data**: Single source of truth for user information
4. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks when authentication issues occur
5. **Improved Development Experience**: Fixed TypeScript compilation issues

## Testing Recommendations:

1. **Authentication Flow**: Test login → navigate between screens → logout
2. **Profile Display**: Verify user information shows correctly on profile screen
3. **Offline Behavior**: Test app behavior when server is unreachable
4. **Screen Navigation**: Ensure smooth navigation without authentication prompts
5. **APK Build**: Test the APK generation process with these changes

## Notes:

- The app now prioritizes local authentication state over server validation for better UX
- Profile information is loaded from `authService` (in-memory) first, then falls back to database storage
- Authentication checks are now lightweight and don't cause UI interruptions
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flow

## Commands to Test:

```bash
# Start development server
cd "C:\Users\Takunda Mundwa\Desktop\MamaCare\MamaCare"
npm run start

# Build APK (when ready)
npm run build:android
```

The app should now run smoothly without constant authentication prompts and display user information correctly in the profile section.
