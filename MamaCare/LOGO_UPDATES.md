## Files Already Using Proper Logo (No Changes Needed):

- ✅ `admin-dashboard/assets/Logo.png` - Asset available

## Logo Usage Examples:

```tsx
// Basic usage
<Logo size={40} />

// Custom dimensions
<Logo width={60} height={40} />

// With custom styling
<Logo size={50} style={{ marginBottom: 20 }} />

// Different resize modes
<Logo size={80} resizeMode="contain" />
```

## Preserved Emoji Icons:
The following emoji icons were **intentionally preserved** as they serve as UI icons rather than branding:

### Tab Navigation Icons:
- 🏠 Home tab
- 🤰 Pregnancy tab (appropriate for pregnancy tracking)
- 💊 Health tab
- 📅 Appointments tab
- 💬 Symptoms tab

### Content-Specific Icons:
- Various health and pregnancy-related emojis in content areas
- Baby development stage emojis (🌱, 🌸, 👶)
- Medical icons (💉, 🏥, 📝, etc.)

These serve as functional UI elements and maintain good user experience.

## Testing Status:
- ✅ App successfully compiles and runs
- ✅ Metro bundler starts without errors
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ Logo component loads correctly
- ✅ All updated screens maintain functionality

## Benefits Achieved:

1. **Brand Consistency**: Actual MamaCare logo used throughout app
2. **Professional Appearance**: Removed emoji representations for cleaner look
3. **Maintainability**: Centralized Logo component for easy updates
4. **Scalability**: Logo component handles different sizes automatically
5. **Performance**: Optimized image loading with proper resize modes

## Next Steps:
The app is now ready for APK generation with consistent branding throughout. The logo updates will be reflected in the built APK, providing a more professional and branded user experience.
