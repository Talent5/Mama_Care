# API Timeout Fixes Implementation

## Problem Summary
The application was experiencing repeated "timeout of 10000ms exceeded" errors when fetching notification stats and other API endpoints. This was causing:
- Continuous error logging in the browser console
- Poor user experience with failed requests
- Potential server overload from repeated failed requests

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Short timeout duration**: 10-second timeout was insufficient for API calls, especially to notification stats endpoints
2. **Aggressive refresh intervals**: Multiple components refreshing data at different intervals (30s, 1min, 2min, 5min)
3. **No request debouncing**: Multiple simultaneous requests to the same endpoints
4. **Poor error handling**: Failed requests were retried immediately without backoff
5. **No backend caching**: Database queries were being executed on every request

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Frontend Timeout Increases
**Files Modified:**
- `admin-dashboard/src/services/api.ts`
- `MamaCare/config/api.ts`

**Changes:**
- Increased admin dashboard timeout from 10,000ms to 30,000ms
- Increased mobile app timeout from 15,000ms to 30,000ms

### 2. Notification Service Improvements
**File Modified:** `admin-dashboard/src/services/notificationService.ts`

**Changes:**
- Added 60-second cooldown between notification fetches
- Implemented exponential backoff for consecutive errors
- Added race conditions with 20-second timeouts for individual requests
- Better error handling with cached fallbacks
- Reset error counts on successful requests

### 3. Request Frequency Reduction
**File Modified:** `admin-dashboard/src/components/layout/Header.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Increased notification refresh interval from 5 minutes to 10 minutes
- Added better error handling in the component

### 4. Backend Optimizations
**Files Modified:**
- `backend/routes/alerts.js`
- `backend/server.js`

**Changes:**
- Added 1-minute in-memory cache for alert stats
- Added 30-second request timeout middleware
- Improved logging for timeout monitoring

## Configuration Summary

### Timeouts
- **Frontend API calls**: 30 seconds (increased from 10-15s)
- **Notification fetch**: 20 seconds with race condition
- **Backend request timeout**: 30 seconds

### Refresh Intervals
- **Notifications**: 10 minutes (600,000ms)
- **System Status**: 2 minutes (120,000ms) 
- **Dashboard Data**: 1 minute with backoff (60,000ms)
- **Patient Activity**: 30 seconds (30,000ms)

### Caching
- **Alert Stats**: 1 minute backend cache
- **Notification Service**: Client-side cache with 60s cooldown

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Console Messages to Monitor
- `✅ Successfully fetched notification stats` - Normal operation
- `🔄 Returning cached notification stats (cooldown active)` - Normal cache hit
- `❌ Failed to fetch notification stats: [error]` - Issues to investigate
- `🔄 Skipping notification fetch (error backoff active: Xms)` - Error recovery mode

### Performance Indicators
1. **Reduced error frequency**: Should see fewer timeout errors in console
2. **Cache hit ratio**: Monitor cached vs fresh requests
3. **Response times**: Average API response times should improve
4. **Error backoff**: Should see automatic recovery from error states

### Manual Recovery Options
If issues persist, the notification service provides methods for manual intervention:
```javascript
// Reset cooldown and error state
notificationService.resetCooldown();

// Check current error state
const { consecutiveErrors, isInBackoff } = notificationService.getErrorState();

// Get cached data without API call
const cachedStats = notificationService.getCurrentStats();
const cachedNotifications = notificationService.getCurrentNotifications();
```

## Expected Results
1. **Reduced error logs**: Fewer timeout errors in browser console
2. **Better user experience**: More responsive dashboard loading
3. **Server efficiency**: Reduced database load from cached stats
4. **Graceful degradation**: App continues working with cached data during API issues
5. **Automatic recovery**: Error backoff allows system to recover from temporary issues

## Next Steps for Production
1. **Monitor logs**: Watch for remaining timeout patterns
2. **Performance testing**: Test under production load conditions
3. **Alert thresholds**: Set up monitoring for API response times > 20s
4. **Database optimization**: Consider indexing Alert collection if stats queries are slow
5. **CDN/Caching**: Implement Redis or similar for production caching

## Rollback Plan
If issues persist:
1. Revert timeout values to original settings
2. Disable notification auto-refresh temporarily
3. Increase cache durations further
4. Consider disabling real-time features temporarily
